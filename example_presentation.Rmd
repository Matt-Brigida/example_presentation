## Presentation

This is an example presentation.  We'll use it to:

- get to know RMarkdown
- get to know git/github.

## Shiny App

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(threejs)
inputPanel(    
   sliderInput("axis1", label = "Max Axis 1", max = .5, min = 0.01, value = .20, step = .01),
   sliderInput("axis2", label = "Max Axis 2", max = .2, min = 0.01, value = .05, step = .01)
   )


renderPlot({
  surf <- cbind(expand.grid(seq(.01, input$axis1, by = .01), seq(.01, input$axis2, by = .01)), 1)
  plot(as.matrix(surf[,1]))
})
```
